# 146. Understanding WHERE vs HAVING

The purpose of `WHERE` clause is to filter data based on a single row, non aggregate data, while the `HAVING` clause is to filter data based on an aggregated data. As a general rule use `WHERE` before the `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` after.

```sql
SELECT column_1_name, COUNT(column_2_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_3_name > 30 -- A filter condition based on an individual value
GROUP BY column_1_name;
```

```sql
SELECT column_1_name, COUNT(column_2_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_1_name
HAVING SUM(column_3_name) > 30; -- A filter condition based on the aggregate value of multiple rows
```
