# 176. Don't Use Too Many Indexes! <!-- markdownlint-disable-line MD026 -->

We should create indexes for all the columns in all the tables of our database. This can lead to poor performance. Whenever data is inserted or update, the index also has to be updated, so if we have to many indexes or data that changes frequently, or both, this can lead to poor performance.

We should have indexes only for specific columns, usually the ones we need to query frequently with some condition.
