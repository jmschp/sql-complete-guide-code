# 98. Forms Of Data Normalization

- 1NF (First Normal Form)
  - Each table cell (column + row) should contain a single value.
  - Each row (record) should be unique.
- 2NF(Second Normal Form)
  - There are no duplicate row values because of multi-column keys (composite keys).
- 3NF (Third Normal Form)
  - All column values in a row are dependent on only the Primary Key.
- BCNF (3.5NF) (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)
  - There must be no conflicting unique identification criteria (i.e. column value combinations) -> Avoid multiple entities in one table.
- 4NF (Fourth Normal Form)
  - All combinations of all (non-key) cell values should be possible
- 5NF (Fifth Normal Form)
  - There are no clashing column values because of implicit column dependencies

> ## Simple Rule
>
> Avoid mixing data entities in the same table, avoid multiple values in a single table cell but also try to avoid splitting basic data across dozens of tables!
