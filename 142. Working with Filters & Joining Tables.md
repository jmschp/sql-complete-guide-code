# 142. Working with Filters & Joining Tables

## With Filter WHERE

Aggregate functions also work with filtering, this way we can perform calculation only on the values returned by the filter.

```sql
SELECT AVG(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE filtering_condition
```

## With JOIN queries

Also possible to use joins in conbination with aggregate functions.

```sql
SELECT
  MAX(t1.num_guests),
  MAX(t2.num_seats)
FROM
  table_1_name AS t1
  INNER JOIN table_2_name AS t2 ON t1.fk_id = t2.id;
```
