# 183. Working With Multi-Column Indexes (Composite Indexes)

To create a multi-column index we just need to add the columns we need to the `CREATE INDEX` statement. We can add several columns in a single index.

Multi-column indexes are specially useful for queries that have filter condition based in 2 or more columns. This filter conditions should use the `AND` instead of the `OR` keyword, because it is the combination of all the columns that matter and not one column alternative to another.

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_1_name, column_2_name, column_3_name, ...);
```

Column order is important for the index creation, this will impact how the RBMS uses the index. If we run a query with all the columns in the index, the index might be used. The RDBMS might use the index if we include in the query the columns in the index from left to right. If we jump a column from the index, for example, we only use second or third column in the query, the RDBMS wil not use the index:

**RDBMS might use index:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE column_1_name = 'something' AND column_2_name = 'something else' AND column_3_name = 'another thing';

SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE column_1_name = 'something';

SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE column_1_name = 'something' AND column_2_name = 'something else';
```

**RDBMS won't use index:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE column_2_name = 'something else';

SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE column_2_name = 'something else' AND column_3_name = 'another thing';
```

Even tough the index covers multiple columns, in case we run a query that uses just one of the columns in the index, the RDBMS might still use that index to improve the query performance.
