# 143. Theory Time - Understanding GROUP BY

## GROUP BY with Aggregate functions

As aggregate functions reduces the multiple input values from a column to a single value, with need the `GROUP BY` clause to use aggregate functions with normal non-aggregate identifier. Without the `GROUP BY` clause it is unclear what the aggregate should be based on.

```sql
SELECT column_1_name, SUM(column_2_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_1_name;
```

For example if we are querying a table that as a column with date values, where some of them can be duplicated, and a second column with integer values, and we want to know the sum for each specific date, we need to group the values by the date column.

```sql
SELECT date_column, SUM(integer_column)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY date_column;
```

If we don't group the values by date, we would get a list of all dates, and the aggregate function would know how to perform the calculation, thus resulting in a error.

## GROUP BY with Multiple Identifiers

If we have multiple column identifiers in our select statement when using `GROUP BY`, we also need to add the identifiers to the `GROUP BY` clause.

```sql
SELECT column_1_name, column_2_name
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_1_name, column_2_name;
```
