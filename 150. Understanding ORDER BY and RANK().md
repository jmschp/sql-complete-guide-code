# 150. Understanding ORDER BY and RANK()

## Window Functions with ORDER BY

The the `ORDER BY` clause within Window Function, determines the order in which the rows of a partition are processed by the Window Function. In the following example, using `SUM()`, and with `ORDER BY` for `column_2_name` sum is taken from the first (lowest) value of `column_2_name` up through the current one, including any duplicates of the current one. The sum stops at the end of a specific partition, and them, restarts in the following one.

```sql
SELECT
  column_1_name,
  column_2_name,
  SUM(column_2_name) OVER (
    PARTITION BY
      column_1_name
    ORDER BY
      column_2_name ASC -- or DSC
  )
FROM
  table_name;
```

Without the `PARTITION BY` clause the sum is taken from the first value all the way to the last without restarting in each partition.

## Window Functions with RANK()

The `RANK()` function is one of the non-aggregate functions, that is made to be used with the Window Function.

PostegesSQL definition

> rank () â†’ bigint

> Returns the rank of the current row, with gaps; that is, the row_number of the first row in its peer group.

```sql
SELECT
  column_1_name,
  column_2_name,
  RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY
      column_1_name
    ORDER BY
      column_2_name DESC
  )
FROM
    table_name;
```
