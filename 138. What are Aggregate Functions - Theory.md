# 138. What are Aggregate Functions - Theory

## Terminology

The `AGGREGATE FUNCTION` keyword is composed by two keywords:

- Aggregate: Mathematical operation returning a single (aggregated) result.
- Function: Predefined operation, which can be executed on demand.

Aggregate functions perform a calculation based in the multiple input values of a column and reducse the result to single value.

## Core Aggregate Functions

- `COUNT()`: count the number of records in an individual column returned in the result set.
- `SUM()`: sum the values of a specific column
- `MAX()`: retrieve the maximum value
- `Min()`: retrieve the minimum value
- `AVG()`: return the average value
