# 157. Working with Weekdays

## Extracting the Weekday in PostgreSQL

In PostgreSQL we can use the `DOW` and `ISODOW` keywords to extract an integer corresponding to the day of the week.

With the `DOW` keyword, the week starts on Sunday with index 0, and ends on Saturday with index 6.

With the `ISODOW` keyword, the week starts on Monday with index 1, and ends on Sunday with index 7.

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(DOW FROM DATE '2022-12-18'); -- 0

SELECT EXTRACT(ISODOW FROM DATE '2022-12-18');-- 7

SELECT EXTRACT(DOW FROM column_date_name)
FROM table_name;

SELECT EXTRACT(ISODOW FROM column_date_name)
FROM table_name;
```

## Extracting the Weekday in MySQL

To extract an integer corresponding to the weekday in MySQL we can use the `WEEKDAY()` function. It has the same index structure as the `DOW` in PostgreSQL. So the week starts on Sunday with index 0, and ends on Saturday with index 6.

```sql
SELECT WEEKDAY('2022-12-18'); -- 6

SELECT WEEKDAY(column_date_name)
FROM table_name;
```

## Converting timestamps in MySQL

We can convert a timestamp to output just the date or time value with the `CONVERT()` function.

```sql
SELECT CONVERT('2022-12-20 14:10:50', DATE); -- 2022-12-20
SELECT CONVERT('2022-12-20 14:10:50', TIME); -- 14:10:50

SELECT CONVERT(column_date_name, DATE), CONVERT(column_date_name, TIME)
FROM table_name;
```

## Converting timestamps in PostgreSQL

In PostgreSQL we can use the `CAST()` function, or the cast operator `::` to convert a timestamp to only date or time value. The `CAST()` is also valid in MySQL.

```sql
SELECT CAST('2022-12-20 14:10:50' AS DATE); -- 2022-12-20
SELECT CAST('2022-12-20 14:10:50' AS TIME); -- 14:10:50

SELECT '2022-12-20 14:10:50'::DATE; -- 2022-12-20
SELECT '2022-12-20 14:10:50'::TIME; -- 14:10:50
```
