# 181. More on Creating & Dropping Indexes

> Besides creating indexes via `CREATE INDEX`, you can also add an index to a table right when creating that table - like this:
>
> ```sql
> CREATE TABLE <table_name> (
>    ... column definitions,
>    INDEX <index_name> (<column>)
> );
> ```
>
> Please note that this is supported when using MySQL but it won't work with PostgreSQL.
>
> You should always dive into the documentation of the database system you're using, to learn which features / syntax is available!
>
> If you want to get rid of an index, you can also always do that via `DROP INDEX <index_name>`.
