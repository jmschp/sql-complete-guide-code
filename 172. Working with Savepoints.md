# 172. Working with Savepoints

We can use `SAVEPOINTS` within a transaction to rollback to a specific moment, instead of rolling back the entire transaction.

```sql
BEGIN;
    INSERT INTO table_name (column_1_name) VALUES (1);
    SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
    INSERT INTO table_name (column_1_name) VALUES (2);
    ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
    INSERT INTO table_name (column_1_name) VALUES (3);
COMMIT;
```

The above example would insert the values `1` and `3` into the table.
