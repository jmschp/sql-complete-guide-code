# 113. What's Wrong With Our Foreign Keys?

Up until now we have been using just a regular column with `INT` data type to establish the relationship, between our tables. But as this are just regular columns, we can insert any data (any id) we want even if it does not exist in the related table. Or we could delete data from one table and end up with invalid data in the related table, in case where it now points to an nonexisting id. There are various ways that we could loose referential integrity between two related tables, using this approach.
