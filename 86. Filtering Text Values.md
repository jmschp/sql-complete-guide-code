# 86. Filtering Text Values

Just like in numbers and dates we can also use the `>`, `>=`, `<`,`<=` operators in text values. When comparing text SQL starts at the first character, and compares one by one. Collation controls how character relate to each other. Typically, character are compared in alphabetic order.
