# 89. Introducing ORDER BY & LIMIT

## ORDER

We can sort our results with the `ORDER BY` clause. By default it sorts by ascending order `ASC`, we can use `DESC` to sort by descending order. We can also sort by multiple columns, this way SQL will sort by the first one and them move to the next one. If the first ordering column does not contain any equal values, the second one will make no diference.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name ASC; --specifying ASC is optional;
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name DESC;
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_1_name DESC, column_2_name;
```

## LIMIT

We can specify a limit to the number of records to be retrieved from the database, using the `LIMIT` clause. We can also add an offset to skip some records. This is a useful feature to create pagination for a website. For example if we want to show 10 result per page, we would limit the result set to 10, and for each page we wouls add 10 to the offset.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
LIMIT x_number;
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
LIMIT x_number
OFFSET y_number;
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
LIMIT 10; -- first page results

SELECT *
FROM table_name
LIMIT 10
OFFSET 10; -- second page results
```

## DISTINCT

To include on distinct records in the result set we can use the `DISTINCT` clause.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM table_name;
```
