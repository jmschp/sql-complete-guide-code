# 119. Data Relationship Types: One-to-Many, Many-to-Many, One-to-ONe

## One-to-Many (1:n)

In the One-to-Many relationship one record in table A has one or many related records in table B. The Foreign Key must be added to the table that has one relation, not the one that has many relations. For example if we have a users table and an address tables, and a user belongs to an address, and an address has many users, then Foreign Key would have to be set in the users table, as an `address_id`.

## Many-to-Many (n:n)

In the Many-to-Many relationship one record in table A has one or many related records in table B, and vice versa. This means we can not set the Foreign Key in either table. So for this type of relation we need a third table to connect the two initial tables, which is usually called a join table or a intermediate table.

## One-to-One (1:1)

In the One-to-One relationship one record in table A belongs to exactly one record in table B, and vice versa. In this type of relation we can set the Foreign Key in either table A or table B, the actual definition will come down to the use case and business logic.
