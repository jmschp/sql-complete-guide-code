# 121. Example: Adding First Tables & Relations

## Employees and Internet accounts

To setup the `employees` and `internet_accounts` tables we need to set a one-to-one relationship. This being a one-to-one, we can set the Foreign Key in either table. The decision will come down to business needs. For example, what should happen if we delete a employee or an internet account? From a business perspective it might make more sense to delete an internet account when the associated employee is deleted, So the internet account is dependent on the employee (it can not exist without an employee). If this is the case we should set the Foreign Key in the `internet_accounts` table with an `ON DELETE CASCADE` action, this way if we delete an employee, its internet acount is also deleted.

For this example we are using the email column as the Foreign Key. Although the email is not the Primary Key of the `employees` table we can use it as a Foreign Key, because it is a unique value.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(300) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(300) NOT NULL,
  birthdate DATE NOT NULL,
  -- email VARCHAR(200) REFERENCES intranet_accounts
  email VARCHAR(200) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE intranet_accounts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(200) REFERENCES employees (email) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  password VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL
);
```
