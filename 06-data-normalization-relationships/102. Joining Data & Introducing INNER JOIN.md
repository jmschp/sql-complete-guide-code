# 102. Joining Data & Introducing INNER JOIN

## INNER JOIN

With the `INNER JOIN` clause we can merge data from multiple tables in one result set. We specify the table we want to make the join with and with the `ON` the columns that make the connection. We can omit the keyword `INNER` as is is the default join.

```sql
SELECT table_a.column_1_name, table_b.column_1_name
FROM table_a
INNER JOIN table_b ON table_b.id = table_a.column_fk_b_id;
```

The result set of `INNER JOIN` will return only matching results, from all tables in the join. So for example if `table_b`, as a row that it is not referenced in `table_a`, that row will not be part of the result set, and vice-versa.

We can set an alias to the table name with `AS`, just to make the SQL statement shorter. Is is also a general good practice to use the dot notation `table_name.column_name`, to reference the columns we need, although this is only required if we have the same column name in both tables.

```sql
SELECT a.column_1_name, b.column_1_name
FROM table_a AS a
INNER JOIN table_b AS b ON b.id = a.column_fk_b_id;
```

## Multiple INNER JOINs

We can combine many joins in on single query. And for each join we can join base on any table thats part of the result set thar was derived upt to the moment we call the join.

```sql
SELECT a.column_1_name, b.column_1_name, c.column_1_name
FROM table_a AS a
INNER JOIN table_b AS b ON b.id = a.column_fk_b_id
INNER JOIN table_c AS c ON c.id = b.column_fk_c_id;
```
