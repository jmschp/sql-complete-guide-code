# 112. UNION & Why It's Different

With the `UNION` clause we can combine multiple result sets, into one, in other words we can append rows to a result set. Usually it is more useful if the structure (columns and data types) of the result sets are the same. If the two result set have different number of columns the it will raise an error.

With `UNION` we combines multiple result sets into one result set by appending rows, with `JOIN` we merge multiple tables into one result set by appending columns.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_a
WHERE id < 3
UNION
SELECT *
FROM table_a
WHERE id > 5;
```
