# 109. What About RIGHT JOIN?

The `RIGHT JOIN` is, obviously the inverse of the `LEFT JOIN`. It is not so commonly used because we can replace a `RIGHT JOIN` with a `LEFT JOIN`. The following examples produce the same result set.

```sql
SELECT a.column_1_name, b.column_1_name, c.column_1_name
FROM table_a AS a
RIGHT JOIN table_b AS b ON b.id = a.column_fk_b_id;
```

```sql
SELECT a.column_1_name, b.column_1_name, c.column_1_name
FROM table_b AS b
LEFT JOIN table_a AS a ON b.id = a.column_fk_b_id;
```
