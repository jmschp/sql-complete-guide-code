# 97. Splitting Data Into Tables

Following the example of the user address, besides splitting the address into multiple columns we could also have a separate table for the address columns. And the address would be referenced in the users table as Foreign Key that points to the Primary Key in the address table. This would be useful, for example, if 2 users add the same address, this way we would avoid dta redundancy.
