# 106. Introducing LEFT JOIN

With the `LEFT JOIN`, also sometimes referred to as **left outer join**, all the records from the left table, `table_a` in this example, will be included. Just as the `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN` does not just  consider the "left table", but the entire result set that was derived up to the `LEFT JOIN` clause.

In the following example, the "left table" would be only the `table_a`.

```sql
SELECT a.column_1_name, b.column_1_name
FROM table_a AS a
LEFT JOIN table_b AS b ON b.id = a.column_fk_b_id;
```

In the following example when we reach the left join with `table_c`, the "left table", is considered the result set up until that moment.

```sql
SELECT a.column_1_name, b.column_1_name, c.column_1_name
FROM table_a AS a
LEFT JOIN table_b AS b ON b.id = a.column_fk_b_id;
LEFT JOIN table_c AS c ON c.id = b.column_fk_c_id;
```
