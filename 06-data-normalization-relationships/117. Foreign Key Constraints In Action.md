# 117. Foreign Key Constraints In Action

So on our example where we have a users table, which has a Foreign Key, `address_id` to the addresses table, the behavior when we delete an address referenced in users is the following, for the repective users that reference the given address:

- `RESTRICT`: we will get an error, preventing the address to be deleted.
- `NO ACTION`: we will get an error, preventing the address to be deletd.
- `CASCADE`: all the users associated with the address will be deleted has well.
- `SET NULL`: the Foreign Key `address_id` will be set to `NULL`.
- `SET DEFAULT`: the Foreign Key `address_id` will be set to a default.
