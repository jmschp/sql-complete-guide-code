# 96. Data Normalization - First Steps

Data Normalization is concept that reduces data redundancy and increases data maintainability, we should split our data across multiple tables, and organize them according to the entities we are working with. Data in each table should be splitted compounded and grouped into multiple, standalone values.

For example, if we are saving an user address, it might be better to split the address into its different components. So instead of having a single address, columns we could have several columns, like, street, postal-code, city and country. This way we could better standardize the data. This is the first step of data normalization.
