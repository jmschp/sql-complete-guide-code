# 100. Creating Tables With Relations

Relations between tables in a database are set by having a column in one table pointing to the **Primary Key** of a second table. For our example where we have a users, addresses and cities tables, we would have a columns in users pointing to the addresses tables, and a columns in addresses pointing to cities.

So users would have an a`address_id` column, which would be a **Foreign Key** to the addresses table. The most common naming convention to the **Foreign Key** column is to use the singular form (one entity) of the table being referenced suffixed by the name of the column makeing the connection, in this case `_id`.

The **Foreign Key** column should have the same data type as the **Primary Key** in the referenced table, in this case `INT`. We can set constrains for the **Foreign Key** like `NOT NULL`, So we wouldn't be able to create an address without a city.

There are more formal ways to establish this connection with SQL, taht we will see in the next lections.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(300) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(300) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(300) NOT NULL,
  address_id INT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE addresses (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  street VARCHAR(300) NOT NULL,
  house_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  city_id INT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE cities (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(300) NOT NULL
);
```
