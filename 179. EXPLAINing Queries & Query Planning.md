# 179. EXPLAINing Queries & Query Planning

## EXPLAIN

With the explain keyword we can view the execution plan of a statement, this will give as a serie of statistics on the query performance. If we have an index setup `EXPLAIN` will also tell us if the query will use an index or not.

```sql
EXPLAIN
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE salary > 12900;
```

**PostgreSQL Explain output:**

| QUERY PLAN                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Seq Scan on users (cost=0.00..10.62 rows=17 width=1556) |
| Filter: (salary > 12900)                                |

The SQL engine will perform a sequencial scan all the rows of the users table to check which match the filter criteria. From [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/using-explain.html#USING-EXPLAIN-BASICS):

> The numbers that are quoted in parentheses are (left to right):
>
> - Estimated start-up cost. This is the time expended before the output phase can begin, e.g., time to do the sorting in a sort node.
> - Estimated total cost. This is stated on the assumption that the plan node is run to completion, i.e., all available rows are retrieved. In practice a node's parent node might stop short of reading all available rows (see the LIMIT example below).
> - Estimated number of rows output by this plan node. Again, the node is assumed to be run to completion.
> - Estimated average width of rows output by this plan node (in bytes).
>
> The costs are measured in arbitrary units determined by the planner's cost parameters (see [Section 20.7.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-query.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-QUERY-CONSTANTS)). Traditional practice is to measure the costs in units of disk page fetches; that is, [seq_page_cost](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-SEQ-PAGE-COST) is conventionally set to 1.0 and the other cost parameters are set relative to that.

## EXPLAIN ANALYZE

Adding `ANALYZE` option keyword, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, the query it is actually executed, and thus we can compare the planning result with the actual execution.
