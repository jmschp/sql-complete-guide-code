# 149. Introducing Window Functions

Windows Functions allows us to perform calculation across a set of related rows, without reducing the result to a single value or a group of values. They can be used with both aggregate and non-aggregate functions.

In the following example, the result set would contain 3 columns, `column_1_name`, `column_2_name` and a third column, created by the Window Function, with the sum of all values in `column_2_name` for all the rows.

```sql
SELECT
  column_1_name,
  column_2_name,
  SUM(column_2_name) OVER () -- Window function
FROM
  table_name;
```

## Using PARTITION BY

With the `PARTITION BY` clause we can perform calculations based on related data. In the following example, the third column created by the Window Function, would contain the calculation group by the values in the `column_1_name`.

```sql
SELECT
  column_1_name,
  column_2_name,
  SUM(column_2_name) OVER (
    PARTITION BY
      column_1_name
  )
FROM
  table_name;
```
