# 130. Introducing Composite Primary Keys

A Composite Primary Key, is a Primary Key that spans multiple columns. Depending on the data we are storing, the combination of two or more columns might be the real unique identification criteria. In such cases the typical `id` column it is consider a surrogate key, and depending on the use case might not be necessary.

A Composite Primary Key can a be a combination, of any columns with any data type.

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  column_1_name INT,
  column_2_name INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (column_1_name, column_2_name) -- The combination of the two values is unique
);
```
