# 132. Composite Foreign Keys

In a case where we have a table with a Composite Primary Key, and we need a Foreign Key referencing this Primary Key, we can use a Composite Foreign Key.

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_a_name (
  column_1_name INT,
  column_2_name INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (column_1_name, column_2_name) -- The combination of the two values is unique
);

CREATE TABLE table_b_name (
  id INT
  column_name VARCHAR(300),
  PRIMARY KEY (id) -- And alternate syntax to set the PRIMARY KEY
  FOREIGN KEY (column_1_name, column_2_name) REFERENCES table_a_name ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
