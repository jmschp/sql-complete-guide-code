# 177. Index Types: An Overview

There are different technical implementations of indexes, that use different algorithms and support different types of comparison operators.

Kind of index:

- Single column: as the name point out it is a index for a single columns.
- Unique: similar to single column, but with an extra layer of protection ensuring all values are unique.
- Multi-column: a composite index tra groups several columns together.
- Partial (PostgreSQL only): to create an index to only part of the table.
