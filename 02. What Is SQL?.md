# 02. What Is SQL?

## SQL - Structured Query Language

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language to work with data. Data that is organized across different tables, that have a clear structure. In each column of a table hold a specific data type, which is defined in the moment we create this column.

We can use SQL to create a database with tables and specific each column and its data type. And then we can use SQL to manipulate the data in these tables.

## RDBMS - Relational Database Management Systems

Relational Database Management System is a software that handles the actual data management and storage, and uses SQL internally to interact with the database.

Examples of RDBMS:
