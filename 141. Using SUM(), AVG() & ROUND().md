# 141. Using SUM(), AVG() & ROUND()

## Sum

With the `SUM()` aggregate function we can calculate the sum of the values in a specific column.

```sql
SELECT SUM(column_name)
FROM table_name
```

PostgreSQL `SUM()` definition:

> sum ( smallint ) → bigint
>
> sum ( integer ) → bigint
>
> sum ( bigint ) → numeric
>
> sum ( numeric ) → numeric
>
> sum ( real ) → real
>
> sum ( double precision ) → double precision
>
> sum ( interval ) → interval
>
> sum ( money ) → money
>
> Computes the sum of the non-null input values.

## Average

With the `AVG()` aggregate function we can calculate the average of the values in a specific column. This function ignore null values in its calculations.

```sql
SELECT AVG(column_name)
FROM table_name
```

PostgreSQL `AVG()` definition:

> avg ( smallint ) → numeric
>
> avg ( integer ) → numeric
>
> avg ( bigint ) → numeric
>
> avg ( numeric ) → numeric
>
> avg ( real ) → double precision
>
> avg ( double precision ) → double precision
>
> avg ( interval ) → interval
>
> Computes the average (arithmetic mean) of all the non-null input values.

## Round

The `ROUND()` function is not an aggregate function, but it is useful to use with aggregate functions, because it allows us to better present results. In the snippet bellow `D`stand for the decimal places, we want to represent.

```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(column_name), D)
FROM table_name
```

PostgreSQL `ROUND()` definition:

> round ( numeric ) → numeric
>
> round ( double precision ) → double precision
>
> Rounds to nearest integer. For numeric, ties are broken by rounding away from zero. For double precision, the tie-breaking behavior is platform dependent, but “round to nearest even” is the most common rule.
>
> round(42.4) → 42
>
> ---
>
> round ( v numeric, s integer ) → numeric
>
> Rounds v to s decimal places. Ties are broken by rounding away from zero.
>
> round(42.4382, 2) → 42.44
