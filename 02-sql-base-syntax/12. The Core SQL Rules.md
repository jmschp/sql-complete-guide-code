# 12. The Core SQL Rules

- SQL statements must end with semicolons – if you got more than one SQL statement in the same command
- A single SQL statement in a command doesn’t need a semicolon at the end
- SQL statements are case-insensitive – SELECT is the same as select
- Identifiers (e.g. table names, column names) can be surrounded with double quotes (or backticks in MySQL) to avoid clashes with built-in keywords
- Statements can consist of one or more clauses – but the order of clauses must be correct (e.g. SELECT before FROM and WHERE)
