# 128. Remember: Primary Keys Don't Have To Be Auto-Incrementing IDs! <!-- markdownlint-disable-line MD026-->

Primary Keys don't have to be auto incrementing integers, they can be other data types, as long as they are unique and not null. For example, if we a have a users table and this users table has a unique, and not null email column, we could use this column as the Primary Key.
