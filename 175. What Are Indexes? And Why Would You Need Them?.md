# 175. What Are Indexes? And Why Would You Need Them?

An Index is a feature provided by a RDBMS that enhances query performance. Without an Index, if we perform some query, that as a condition like `WHERE column_name > 10`, the RDBMS would have to go through each row of the table to check if it satisfies the given condition, thus being slow and inefficient.

When we create a Index for a column, the data in this column is saved by the RDBMS in a B-Tree data structure (this is the default, but there are other). The values on this data structure are sorted and connect to the original table, so when we run a query we don't have to look at all the rows but only at those that satisfy the condition.
