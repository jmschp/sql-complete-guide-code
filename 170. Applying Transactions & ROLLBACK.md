# 170. Applying Transactions & ROLLBACK

To start a transaction we use the `START TRANSACTION` statement (alias `BEGIN`). When we run this command a transaction block is initiated for the current session. All the queries executed after the `START TRANSACTION`, will be executed in a single transaction until an explicit `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` is given.

The `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` statements terminate a transaction.

The result of each query within the transaction is saved in memory of the transaction session, and in case of all being successful a `COMMIT` can be issued and the changes are written to the database, otherwise a `ROLLBACK` can be issued and all the changes are not applied.

```sql
START TRANSACTION

INSERT INTO table_1_name (
  column_1_name, column_2_name,
)
VALUES (
  'value 1', 2
)
-- somewhere around the transaction and error occurs
INSERT INTO table_2_name (
  column_1_name, column_2_name,
)
VALUES (
  'value 4', 5
)

ROLLBACK -- in case of an error, no change is applied, and transaction terminates
```

```sql
START TRANSACTION

INSERT INTO table_1_name (
  column_1_name, column_2_name,
)
VALUES (
  'value 1', 2
)

INSERT INTO table_2_name (
  column_1_name, column_2_name,
)
VALUES (
  'value 4', 5
)

COMMIT -- in case of all successful, changes are written to database,and transaction terminates
