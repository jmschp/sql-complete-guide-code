# 71. Selecting Data: Theory

## SELECT

To read all the data we use the `SELECT` command. We can use an `*` that specifies all the columns, or we can just fetch specific columns. The data snapshot returned by `SELECT` is called the result set.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name;
```

When using specific columns names, we can declare then in any order we like, and the data will be returned in the order we specified.

```sql
SELECT column_1_name, columns_2_name
FROM table_name;
```

## SELECT with WHERE

We can use the `WHERE` clause to specify a condition for the dta fetching. A condition can be, for example, fetcg rows where columns value is greater than 0.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE <condition>;
```
