# 87. Working With Dates & Date Differences

## Date format

When working with dates in the **aaaa-mm-dd** format, like for example `2022-11-18`, we can perform calculation and it will return the value in days.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sales
WHERE date_fulfilled - date_created <= 5; -- will return the difference in days
```

## Extract

A useful function is the `EXTRACT()`, in both MySQL and PostgreSQL. For example, if we where working with timestamps we can extract date information from them.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sales
WHERE EXTRACT(
    DAY
    FROM timestamp_1 - timestamp_2
  ) <= 5;
```
