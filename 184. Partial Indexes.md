# 184. Partial Indexes

With Partial Indexes we can create an Index that only cover part of the values in the table, and not the entire table. This feature it is only supported by PostgreSQL (at the moment MySQL 8.0.31 does not supor partial indexes).

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name)
WHERE <some condition>
```

For our use case, where we have a users table with a integer salary column, lets say we usually only need to query for salaries greater than 12000. This could be a senario to set up a partial index.

```sql
CREATE INDEX salary ON users (salary)
WHERE salary > 12000;
```
