# 116. Updating & Removing Foreign Key Constraints

> Besides adding Foreign Key constraints at creation time (i.e. when using CREATE TABLE), you can also add such constraints after a table has been created with help of `ALTER TABLE`. You can also remove Foreign Key constraints from an existing table.

> In order to `DROP` a Foreign Key constraint (just as for dropping any other kind of constraint), you need to assign a name to the constraint when adding it.

> This can be done like this:

>
> ```sql
> CREATE TABLE <table_name> (
>   <column_name> <column_data_type> FOREIGN KEY <constraint_name> REFERENCES ...
> );
> ```
>
> The `FOREIGN KEY` part (i.e. `FOREIGN KEY <constraint_name>`) is only required if a name should be assigned. If you don't need a name (because you don't plan on dropping the constraint at any time), you can omit `FOREIGN KEY` - just as we did in the lectures.

> There also are ways of dropping constraints without names but it's a bit more complicated - see: [StackOverflow: How to drop SQL default constraint without knowing its name?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1430456/how-to-drop-sql-default-constraint-without-knowing-its-name)
