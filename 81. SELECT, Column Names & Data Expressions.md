# 81. SELECT, Column Names & Data Expressions

## Columns alias

We can use an alias for the columns name we specify using the `SELECT` command, with the `AS` keyword. This will not change the column name in the database, but will just rename the column in the result set.

```sql
SELECT
  column_2_name AS column_1_alias,
  column_2_name AS column_2_alias
FROM table_name;
```

## SELECT hardcoded and calculated values

We can also use some value to be add to the result set in all the rows, or we can perform some calculation. This will not affect the data in the database, but will just modify the data returned in the result set.

```sql
SELECT
  'Hello World', --- This hardcoded string will be on all the rows of the result set.
  10000, --  This hardcoded integer will be on all the rows of the result set.
  product_name,
  volume / 10000 -- The volume will be return divided by 10000, and the column name will be "volume / 1000 unless we assign an alias."
FROM sales;
```
