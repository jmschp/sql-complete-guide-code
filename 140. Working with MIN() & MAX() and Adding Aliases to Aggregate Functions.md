# 140. Working with MIN() & MAX() and Adding Aliases to Aggregate Functions

## Maximum

With the `MAX()` aggregate function we can get the maximum value of a specific column. This function works with several data types.

```sql
SELECT MAX(column_name)
FROM table_name;
```

PostgreSQL `MAX()` definition:

> max ( see text ) → same as input type
>
> Computes the maximum of the non-null input values. Available for any numeric, string, date/time, or enum type, as well as inet, interval, money, oid, pg_lsn, tid, xid8, and arrays of any of these types.

## Minimum

With the `MIN()` aggregate function we can get the minimum value of a specific column. This function works with several data types.

```sql
SELECT MIN(column_name)
FROM table_name;
```

PostgreSQL `MIN()` definition:

> min ( see text ) → same as input type
>
> Computes the minimum of the non-null input values. Available for any numeric, string, date/time, or enum type, as well as inet, interval, money, oid, pg_lsn, tid, xid8, and arrays of any of these types.

## Combine multiple aggregate functions

We can combine multiple aggregate functions in a single query. It can be useful to add aliases to each of them to better identify the result set.

```sql
SELECT
  MAX(colum_1_name) AS aliases_1,
  MIN(column_1_name) AS aliases_2
FROM table_name;
```
